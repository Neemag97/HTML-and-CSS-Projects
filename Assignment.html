		<P> 
		These spiders have deserved their name from their characteristics to pursue prey before they eat it. These spiders match lone wolves, who have all the dormant traits needed to capture their prey and then eat it. The wolf spiders maintain various kinds of personalities, which is potential within the same type of species. They live their lives far away from others, including their own kind. Wolf spiders come in contact with female wolf spiders during the mating season. These spiders are highly venomous, implying that they kill their prey with the venom present in their bodies. The venom of a wolf spider is enough to paralyze their prey. They don’t present a lot of threat to humans unless they feel trapped and threatened. </p>
